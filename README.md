# Chest X-Ray Classification System Using CNN

## Description
This project presents a Chest X-Ray Classification System utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) built with standard libraries in Python, including Keras and TensorFlow. The system is designed to classify chest X-ray images into different categories, such as healthy or diseased, with the aim of assisting in the early detection and diagnosis of various thoracic conditions.

## Features
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Implemented using Keras and TensorFlow to effectively learn and identify patterns in X-ray images.
- **Preprocessing**: Includes steps like resizing, normalization, and augmentation of images to improve model performance.
- **Model Training**: Trained on a labeled dataset of chest X-ray images, with options for tuning hyperparameters and monitoring performance through metrics like accuracy and loss.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the model using test data and provides metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Prediction**: Allows for the classification of new chest X-ray images, providing a diagnosis based on the trained model.
